# Capstone
Capstone project-Private
In this project that is dedicated towards my capstone project
I am creating a website accessible to all but with a free to use according to the Lebanese American University laws and regulations
This website is dedicated to both locals and foriegners to acesss a web-page that displays touristic sites and restaurants.

This issue that I am trying to fix here is to reduce the number of searches a person makes trying to see where to go in a certain country
The more time a person spends searching the less they want to go to set country
Allowing all the connections in one place with locations and more info to set location I belive that this is a good website idea.
